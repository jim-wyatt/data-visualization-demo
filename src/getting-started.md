# Getting Started

This section covers how to set up your environment and run the notebook.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9 or later** (3.10+ recommended)
- **pip** (usually comes with Python; verify with `pip --version`)
- A terminal or command prompt
- ~2GB of disk space (for venv + dependencies)

### System Requirements

The notebook can run on any modern OS (Linux, macOS, Windows). Some optional features require extra system packages (see below).

## What You'll Need

1. **Python packages** — listed in `requirements.txt` (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, jupyter, datashader, etc.).
2. **Optional: LaTeX** — for direct PDF export via `nbconvert --to pdf`. Install TeX Live (Linux) or MacTeX (macOS).
3. **Optional: Chromium/Chrome** — for headless HTML->PDF conversion (alternative to LaTeX).
4. **Optional: ffmpeg** — for exporting animations to MP4 format.
